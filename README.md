Scavenger Hunt

Simple scavenger hunt game based on Google Maps API designed for office entertainment.<br>
Clues are added to Google Maps markers and, if the user is close enough, the clue will be displayed on screen.<br>

There is, intentionally, no option to add answers on screen because this application had a very specific purpose as part of a wider office 'game'.<br>

Class map styling used and overlay for the appearance of an old-style parchment map.

## Scavenger Hunt

### UX Overview

#### Brief

This website was created as a simple scavenger hunt game for an office entertainment evening.<br>
The objectives were to provide a fun game requiring users to travel around the local town looking for clues shown on the website which became 'active' based on the user's location.<br>
Clues are added to Google Maps markers and, if the user is close enough, the clue will be displayed on screen.<br>

#### User Stories

Users would need to:
- Easily see where clues were located in the vicinity;
- Understand if they were close enough to a clue to 'activate' it;
- Easily see their location relative to clues;
- Retrieve instructions on how to use the website;
- Scroll around the map to locate clues;
- Recentre on their location; and
- Zoom in and out to better see clue locations.

### Purpose

This website is designed as a one off interactive front end site with a fun appearance to make users feel that they were following a 'treasure map'. Class map styling is used and an overlay for the appearance of an old-style parchment map.<br>
There is, intentionally, no option to add answers on screen because this application has a very specific purpose as part of a wider office 'game'. The site enables users to locate clues in the area, figure out the answer based on local landmarks or objects of note. The users would then return a central location to share their answers. The team with the most correct answers wins. <br>
The site comprises a single webpage with initial introduction overlay containing a single 'start' button. <br>
The styled ***Google Maps API*** is displayed with which users interact.<br>
The location of clues is shown by red flags. If a user is close enough to a flag the clue is displayed in a modal by the user clicking on the flag. If they are not close enough an error modal is displayed stating the user needs to move closer to the location.<br>
